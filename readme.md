## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **🔧 Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **🚨 Installation Problems**

| Problem | Solution | Prevention |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **"Package not found"** | `pip install package_name` | Use requirements.txt |
| **"Permission denied"** | `pip install --user package_name` | Use virtual environments |
| **"Python not found"** | Install Python 3.7+ | Check PATH variables |
| **"Jupyter not starting"** | `pip install --upgrade jupyter` | Regular updates |

#### **📱 Platform-Specific Issues**

**Google Colab Problems:**
```python
# Problem: Can't access local files
# Solution: Mount Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Problem: Package not available
# Solution: Install in notebook
!pip install package_name

# Problem: Runtime disconnected  
# Solution: Reconnect and rerun from checkpoint
# Prevention: Save progress frequently
```

**Local Jupyter Issues:**
```bash
# Problem: Kernel not starting
# Solution: 
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user

# Problem: Port already in use
# Solution: Use different port
jupyter notebook --port=8889

# Problem: Browser not opening
# Solution: Manual navigation
# Go to: http://localhost:8888
```

#### **📊 Data & Memory Issues**

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Out of Memory** | Kernel crashes, slow performance | Reduce batch size, clear variables |
| **Dataset not loading** | File not found errors | Check file paths, use absolute paths |
| **Slow execution** | Long wait times | Use smaller datasets for learning |
| **GPU not detected** | CUDA errors | Enable GPU in Colab runtime settings |

#### **🔍 Debugging Tips**

**Step-by-Step Debugging:**
1. **Read error messages carefully** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check variable types** - Use `type()` and `shape` to inspect data
3. **Print intermediate results** - Add print statements to track execution
4. **Use smaller datasets** - Test with sample data first
5. **Search error messages** - Google the exact error for solutions

**Common Error Patterns:**
```python
# IndexError: Fix array/list indexing
print(f"Array shape: {array.shape}, Index: {index}")

# KeyError: Check dictionary keys
print(f"Available keys: {list(dict.keys())}")

# ValueError: Check data types and shapes
print(f"Expected shape: {expected}, Got: {actual.shape}")

# ImportError: Install missing packages
!pip install missing_package_name
```

### **🆘 Getting Help**

**Before asking for help, try:**
1. ✅ Read the error message completely
2. ✅ Check the troubleshooting section above
3. ✅ Search existing GitHub issues
4. ✅ Try running the code in a fresh environment
5. ✅ Simplify the problem to minimal example

**When asking for help, include:**
